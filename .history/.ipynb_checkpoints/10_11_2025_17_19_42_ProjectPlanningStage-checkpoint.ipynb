    "# Data Description\n",
    "The dataset is separated into two lists. One is a list of 196 unique players with 7 variables of data on each player:\n",
    "- experience, their experience as one of 'Beginner', 'Regular', 'Amateur', 'Veteran', or 'Pro' (chr)\n",
    "- hashedEmail, Private hashed email address (chr)\n",
    "- name, player name (chr)\n",
    "- gender, player gender (chr)\n",
    "- played_hours, number of hours they have played on the server (dbl)\n",
    "- Age, player age in years (dbl)\n",
    "- subscribe, whether or not they are subscribed to a games-related news letter (lgl)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some issues I noticed with this list was that experience hierarchy is unclear (such as wehther or not 'Regular' is more experienced than 'Amatuer'), there are NA values in the age, and that it is unclear which news letter the players are subscribed to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other is a list of individual play sessions with 5 variables on each session:\n",
    "- hashedEmail, private hashed email address (chr)\n",
    "- start_time, start time of session in day/month/year time (chr)\n",
    "- end_time, end time of session in day/month/year time (chr)\n",
    "- original_start_time, Unix epoch start time in milliseconds (dbl)\n",
    "- original_end_time, Unix epoch end time in milliseconds (dbl)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some issues I noticed with this list is that the start and end include the time and date in the same column, and should probably be seperated. It also lacks the session time length, which is probably the most basic piece of data which should be included as it's own column. "
